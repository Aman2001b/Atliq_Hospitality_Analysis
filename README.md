# Atliq_Hospitality_Analysis
In this project, I have built a Power BI dashboard to analyze the 3 months data of different hotels of a company called "Atliq" across 4 different cities in India. This dashboard can help the company to take data-driven decisions to increase its market share and revenue.
# Problem Statement
Atliq is a company that owns multiple hotels across 4 cities in India.Due to high competition in the market and ineffective decisionn-making in the management, Atliq is losing its market share and revenue.As a strategic move the MD of the company wants to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" in order to get business insights and make data_driven decisions to regain their market share and revenue.However, they do not have in-house Data Analytics team to provide them with these insights.So, they have decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
# Tasks
-> Create metrics as per the metrics list provided.
-> Create a dashboard as per the mock-up provided by the stakeholder.
-> Derive relevant insights from the dashboard.
